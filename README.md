# Multifokus
This projected initiated in 2020 by a person affected by:

## Hyperaktivitätsstörung

Such situation is by him renamed as Multifokus, and is here in 
attempting to discussing models for describing the AllTag 
working von a perspective of persons experience. Nevertheless,
profissional experts contributions is welcoming, if they 
could influence the code modelling, mainly in Python and 
JavaSkript. Ops! I know the correct form is Javascript, but 
the pleasure of writing so is bigger than the pleasure of 
write correctly. And by the way I am not native 
Englischsprachig, nor German. I write good texts only in 
Portuguese. That is so: I believe that the rules of 
correctness should apply in hard way only in the native 
language of the writer emitter. In soft friendly way, 
nevertheless, corrections warnings are sometimes welcome, 
since such warning do not be the first comunication. 
Preferently, I accept opinions in balanced way. If not good 
to say I dislike dislikes. If sayd something good, I accept 
dislikes. If make me a cumpliment when I make an error, my 
desire to please you will lead me to realize the error, as a 
consequence, I will improve that point: Dale Carnegie, sayd 
that, if i am not deceived.
 
## The language in Projekt Multifokus, barely focus in just one language, but in:

### Deutsch, Português (do Basil), English

### About natural language in text or code

"""Wenn solche ist verfasst beim Autor dieser Projekt:
In deutsche Zustand trefft sein Tastatur eingestellt, 
obwohl weniger sicher Ideen, viele Fehler, in kaum ausgedrückt Sätzen, empfehlen 
Mitgefühl den deutschsprachigen Lesern;

o português expressa com perfeicao suas ideias, e nas discussoes nas quais se exigir
maior exatidao e precisao em suas manifestacoes, ela será usada em sua defesa final.
Isto apesar de o seu teclado só falar alemao. Nao tem til indicativo de nasalidade,
por exemplo;
English is used with reluctance, despite its advantages, and if one word in English
has an Äquivalent in German, it will be in the first version of the file, whose
connected idea is divisable. After some time, the pleasure of German Expressivity
will be weighted again and less emotive concerns will be considered.
"""

### Python-PEP8 compliance und Namen, Literalen und so weiter

"""used in code of Projekt Multifokus
"""

### Hyperaktivitätsstörung, ADHS, TDAH, H-DAD

### Code as agent of personification [and | or] emulation of behaviour

"""Perhaps, these idea crazy could be, but only if suficiently crazy might be
correct: I am not sure if the sentence is exactly so, nor even if was sayd in English.
I believe the physicist Niels Bohr sad this, however my version is adapted
to the Multifokus Hyperactive Environment: only if I continue in the same crazy idea,
it will be the chance of usefull become - in this consequence, it matter less its
crazy conception than its recognized service - I am undergraduated in Physics and
I know at least one incoherent model in conception, but largely used used still today,
despite of better models exist. Indeed, everyone knows this: it is the Bohr-Rutherford
model of energy layers whose electrons are thought to populate, while orbiting the
centered nucleous of protons and neutrons: with this model is very easy calculate which
proportion will occur if one substance interact with other. By instance, if I have
Alumin and Oxygeny as solely substances in a compound, this model forecast correctly
that in each molecule in referred compound, two atoms of Alumin, through electronic
layers, connected to three atoms of Oxygeny must be. Even with the model being
imperfect since its conception. A crazy idea, but a extremly usefull idea. 

Python code is used in such a way to pretend (or emulate) himself or his output as an
multifocalische hiperactive disorder behaviour

### A first taste of coding the multifokus and hyperactivity in Python

plan = "write an essay about" + "das_Thema" + "when"

class Multifokus:
    def __init__(self, new_idea, when):

        self.next = new_idea
        self.present_task = when
        
x = Multifokus("it is about an important point", "I see nachdem this")

print(x.next)

print(x.present_task)
    
present_task = ("Escrever um ensaio sobre acessibilidade e inclusao com \n "
                "o seguinte título \n " + plan)
                
Wow 100 lines. And I am hyperactive.
